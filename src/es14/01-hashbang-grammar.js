/* Hashbang is a character sequence proceeding an executable script. It defines the interpreter for the program to run. 

When the loader of the Linux Kernel executes the program, the host strips Hashbang to generate valid source code before passing it down to the JavaScript engine. The first line, i.e., Hashbang, is not a valid JS Code and needs to be removed before the source code goes to the engine for execution. The "Hashbang Grammar" feature proposed by Bradley Farias standardizes its procedure. */

// #!/usr/bin/env node
console.log("I am the first line");

/*The feature suggests enhancing the syntax of JavaScript. Additionally, removing the first line before executing the code will not require the extra step.*/
